# Operational Learnings

Record things you learn about running agents, common errors and fixes, and infrastructure quirks.
Add entries under dated headings. Keep entries concise — one line per learning.

**DO NOT store secrets, API keys, or tokens in this file.**

<!-- Example:
## 2026-02-17
- Stale `.sock` files cause bridge "connect ENOENT" errors. Always run `startup-cleanup.sh` with live UUIDs on boot.
- `varlock run` must be used (not `source .env`) when launching agents in tmux — ensures schema validation.
