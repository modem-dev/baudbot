<!-- Example:
## YYYY-MM-DD — Sentry alert: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined" in myapp ingest
- **Root cause**: Missing null check in webhook handler when receiving empty metadata
- **Fix**: PR #NNN — added defensive check + test
- **Watch for**: Similar null access errors in other handlers
