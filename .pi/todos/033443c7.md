OpenClaw has "Everything we built so far" — we need a capabilities section that explains what Baudbot agents can actually do.

Sections to add, after "Why" and before "Requirements":

### Agent Roles
- **Control agent** — orchestrates, triages incoming requests, delegates to workers, monitors email
- **Dev agent** — full coding loop: branch → code → test → PR → fix CI → repeat
- **Sentry agent** — monitors Sentry alerts, investigates via API, triages and reports

### What Agents Can Do
- Read/write files, run shell commands (via tool-guard + safe-bash)
- Git operations: clone, branch, commit, push, create PRs via `gh`
- Docker builds (via security wrapper that blocks privilege escalation)
- Inter-session communication (agents can message each other)
- Monitor email inboxes (AgentMail integration)
- Cloud browser automation (Kernel browser)
- Cron-like loops with breakout conditions
- Todo management (file-based, claimable across sessions)
- Sentry issue investigation via API

Keep it concise — more like a feature list, not a wall of prose like OpenClaw's "Everything we built so far".
