OpenClaw has skills registry / workspace docs. We should briefly explain how to add custom agent roles — it's one of our strengths.

Short section near the end (after Tests, before Security):

### Adding Agents

Baudbot ships with three agent roles but you can add more. An agent role is just a skill file:

1. Create `pi/skills/my-agent/SKILL.md` with role instructions
2. Add a startup block to the control agent's `startup-cleanup.sh`
3. Deploy: `~/baudbot/bin/deploy.sh`

Skills are markdown files with frontmatter. The agent loads them at session start and follows the instructions. See `pi/skills/dev-agent/SKILL.md` for the pattern.

Keep this very short — point to the existing skill files as examples.
