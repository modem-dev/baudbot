**Like Openclaw, but designed for software teams that ship.**

Baudbot runs AI agents as isolated Linux processes with defense-in-depth security. Agents code, test, deploy, monitor, and triage. They work on real repos with real tools. The infrastructure assumes agents *will* be prompt-injected and builds kernel-level walls that hold when the LLM is compromised.

Built for Linux. Uses iptables, `/proc` hidepid, and Unix user isolation. Every PR is integration-tested on fresh Ubuntu 24.04 and Arch Linux droplets.

## Why

Every agent framework gives the model shell access and hopes for the best. Baudbot enforces:

- **OS-level isolation.** Dedicated Unix user, no sudo, can't see other processes.
- **Network control.** iptables per-UID port allowlist. Standard ports only (80/443/22/53). No listeners, no reverse shells on non-standard ports.
- **Source/runtime separation.** Agent can't read or modify its own infrastructure.
- **Dual-layer command blocking.** Dangerous patterns caught at two independent layers.
- **Self-healing.** Permissions hardened on every boot, secrets redacted from logs.

No sandbox friction. Agents make real branches, run real tests, push real PRs. But they can't escalate privileges or open reverse shells.

## Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|--|---------|-------------|
| **OS** | Ubuntu 24.04 or Arch Linux | Any systemd-based Linux |
| **RAM** | 4 GB (3 agents) | 8 GB (6 agents + builds/tests) |
| **CPU** | 2 vCPU | 4 vCPU |
| **Disk** | 20 GB | 40 GB+ (repos, node_modules, Docker images) |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modem-dev/baudbot.git ~/baudbot
sudo ~/baudbot/install.sh
```

The installer detects your distro, installs dependencies, creates the agent user, sets up the firewall, and walks you through API keys. Takes ~2 minutes.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (without installer)</summary>

```bash
# Creates user, firewall, permissions (run as root)
sudo bash ~/baudbot/setup.sh <admin_username>

# Add secrets
sudo -u baudbot_agent vim ~/.config/.env

# Deploy source to agent runtime
~/baudbot/bin/deploy.sh

# Launch
sudo -u baudbot_agent ~/runtime/start.sh
```

See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for the full list of secrets and how to obtain them.

## Configuration

Secrets live in `~baudbot_agent/.config/.env` (not in repo, 600 perms).
See [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) for all keys and how to obtain each value.

## Agents

Baudbot ships three agent roles. The control agent starts automatically and spawns the others in tmux sessions.

| Role | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **control-agent** | Monitors email inbox, triages requests, delegates to workers, runs Slack bridge |
| **dev-agent** | Full coding loop: branch, code, test, PR, fix CI, repeat |
| **sentry-agent** | Watches Sentry alerts, investigates via API, reports triage to control agent |

Agents can read/write files, run shell commands, create git branches and PRs, build Docker images (via a security wrapper), message each other across sessions, monitor email inboxes, automate cloud browsers, and manage shared todos.

## Integrations

| Integration | How |
|---|---|
| **Slack** | Socket Mode bridge. @mentions + channel monitoring. Rate-limited, content-wrapped. |
| **GitHub** | SSH + PAT. Branches, commits, PRs via `gh`. |
| **Email** | AgentMail inboxes. Send, receive, monitor. |
| **Sentry** | API integration. Alert forwarding from Slack channel. |
| **Docker** | Security wrapper blocks privilege escalation. |
| **Cloud browser** | Kernel browser + Playwright automation. |

Slack is the primary human interface. Email is for agent-to-agent and automated workflows.

## How it works

The control agent spawns sub-agents in tmux sessions and starts the Slack bridge. Messages flow through layered security:

```
Slack → bridge (access control + content wrapping) → pi agent → tools (tool-guard + safe-bash) → workspace
```

Every layer assumes the previous one failed. The bridge wraps content and rate-limits, but tool-guard blocks dangerous commands even if wrapping is bypassed. Safe-bash blocks patterns even if tool-guard is evaded. The firewall blocks non-standard ports even if all software layers fail.

### Heartbeat

The control agent runs a periodic heartbeat loop (default: every 10 minutes) that checks system health:

- Are all agent sessions alive?
- Is the Slack bridge responsive?
- Is the email monitor running?
- Are there stale worktrees or stuck todos?

The checklist lives in `HEARTBEAT.md` — edit it to add custom checks. The heartbeat extension (`heartbeat.ts`) handles scheduling, error backoff, and the `heartbeat` tool for runtime control. If the checklist is empty, no heartbeat fires (saves tokens).

## Architecture

```
admin_user (your account)
├── ~/baudbot/                    ← source repo (agent CANNOT read)
│   ├── bin/                         deploy, firewall, security scripts
│   ├── pi/extensions/               🔒 tool-guard, auto-name, etc.
│   ├── pi/skills/                   agent skill templates
│   ├── slack-bridge/                🔒 bridge + security module
│   └── setup.sh / start.sh         system setup + launcher

baudbot_agent (unprivileged uid)
├── ~/runtime/                   ← deployed copies of bin/, bridge
├── ~/.pi/agent/
│   ├── extensions/                  deployed extensions (read-only)
│   ├── skills/                      agent-owned (can modify)
│   ├── HEARTBEAT.md                 periodic health check checklist
│   └── baudbot-manifest.json        SHA256 integrity hashes
├── ~/workspace/                     project repos + worktrees
└── ~/.config/.env                   secrets (600 perms)
```

Deploy is a one-way push: `~/baudbot/bin/deploy.sh` stages source to `/tmp`, copies as `baudbot_agent` via `sudo -u`, stamps an integrity manifest, and cleans up.

## Operations

```bash
# Deploy after editing source
~/baudbot/bin/deploy.sh

# Launch agent (tmux for persistence)
tmux new-window -n baudbot 'sudo -u baudbot_agent ~/runtime/start.sh'

# Security audit
~/baudbot/bin/security-audit.sh
~/baudbot/bin/security-audit.sh --deep   # includes extension scanner

# Monitor agent sessions
sudo -u baudbot_agent tmux ls

# Kill everything
sudo -u baudbot_agent pkill -u baudbot_agent

# Uninstall
sudo ~/baudbot/bin/uninstall.sh --dry-run   # preview
sudo ~/baudbot/bin/uninstall.sh             # for real

# Check deployed version
sudo -u baudbot_agent cat ~/.pi/agent/baudbot-version.json
```

## Tests

```bash
# All 207 tests across 5 suites
bin/test.sh

# JS/TS only
bin/test.sh js

# Shell only
bin/test.sh shell

# Lint + typecheck
npm run lint && npm run typecheck
```

## Adding agents

An agent role is a skill file. Baudbot ships three but you can add more.

1. Create `pi/skills/my-agent/SKILL.md` with role instructions.
2. Add a startup block to the control agent's `startup-cleanup.sh`.
3. Deploy: `~/baudbot/bin/deploy.sh`

See `pi/skills/dev-agent/SKILL.md` for the pattern.

## Security stack

| Layer | What | Survives prompt injection? |
|-------|------|---------------------------|
| **Source isolation** | Source repo is admin-owned. Agent has zero read access. Deploy is one-way. | ✅ Filesystem |
| **iptables egress** | Per-UID port allowlist (80/443/22/53 + DB ports). Blocks non-standard ports, listeners, raw sockets. | ✅ Kernel |
| **Process isolation** | `/proc` mounted `hidepid=2`. Agent can't see other PIDs. | ✅ Kernel |
| **Shell deny list** | `baudbot-safe-bash` blocks rm -rf, reverse shells, fork bombs, curl\|sh. Root-owned. | ✅ Root-owned |
| **Tool interception** | Pi extension blocks dangerous tool calls before they hit disk or shell. | ✅ Read-only |
| **Integrity manifest** | Deploy stamps SHA256 hashes. Security audit verifies runtime files match. | ✅ Admin-signed |
| **Content wrapping** | External messages wrapped with security boundaries + homoglyph sanitization. | ⚠️ LLM-dependent |
| **Injection detection** | 12 regex patterns flag suspicious content. Log-only. | ⚠️ Detection only |
| **Filesystem hardening** | 700 dirs, 600 secrets, enforced on every boot. | ✅ Boot script |
| **Log redaction** | Scrubs API keys, tokens, private keys from session logs. | ✅ Boot script |
| **Extension scanning** | Static analysis for exfiltration, obfuscation, crypto-mining patterns. | ✅ Audit-time |
